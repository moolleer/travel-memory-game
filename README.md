Travel Memory is a travel themed memory game where the user should pair together different items related to traveling. 
Its for people who wants to play a quick and easy game while also training their memory at the same time. The game also has a timer and turnscore for the people who wish to improve their result, or to compete against others.  
The game is designed for users of any age to play and enjoy.

## Features

### Design

- The design of the website was thoughtout to match the images and background.
- A white text color with text shadow is used to give a good contrast against the blue background. 
- The color palette for the website was generated from [My Color](https://mycolor.space/) and I used color #00A9C6.

The Game
- The game consists of 16 cards on a 4x4 grid. At the top there is a home button represented by a home icon, and a restart game button represented by a rounded arrow icon for the users understanding on how to navigate.
- Game starts when the user clicks on any card. The cursor also turns into a pointer when hovering over the cards for the user experience. When a card has been clicked, the timer starts and the turnscore counts every time the second card have been checked for a match. If there is a match, the card stays turned. The user could also reset the game at any time by clicking the reset button. Then the cards that have been matched turns back and the timer and turnscore stops and resets to the initial state. When the home button is clicked the game finishes and returns to the home page.

### Future Features
- For future features I would like to add a high score bord to the game. The user would then be able to add their name and record their turnscores and time.
- Adding sound animation for flipping cards, and when the user tries to click on a card when the game grid is locked.
